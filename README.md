# fpga_layers

This directory contains both the source code and the relevant documentation which we used for implementing conovolutional neural networks for image recognition on the Virtex-7 FPGA using AlexNet.

The source code for each of the layers (conv, pool, lrn, relu) can be found under the corresponding "_layers" directory.

The documentation (term presentations, research papers consulted) can be found under the docs directory.

The final report is called "ECE1373HLS_CNN_Final_Project_Report.pdf" and can be found under "docs".

It is hoped that this project would serve as a useful reference for anyone wishing to work in the same field.
